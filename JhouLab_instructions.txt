FIRST TIME INSTRUCTIONS:

Install miniconda, then open conda prompt (not regular cmd.exe), and enter: conda init cmd.exe

This allows "conda" command to be accessible from normal cmd.exe prompt, which you can launch from GitHub Desktop into the ezTrack repository folder, which is essential for this to work.

Now clone ezTrack from here: https://github.com/JhouLab/ezTrack

Then follow instructions here: https://github.com/denisecailab/ezTrack/wiki/Installation

In brief, type the following into command prompt:

conda create -y -n ezTrack -c conda-forge python=3.9.16 jupyter=1.0.0 numpy=1.24 scipy=1.11.1 pandas=2.0.3 opencv=4.7.0 holoviews=1.15.0 bokeh=2.4.0 pyviz_comms=2.1 jinja2=3.1.2 scikit-learn=1.3.0 matplotlib=3.7.2 tqdm=4.65.0

Need to install one more package so that hv.save() will work:

conda install selenium



INSTRUCTIONS AFTER FIRST TIME:

Launch cmd.exe from GitHub Desktop by right-clicking repository titlebar, and selecting "Open in Command Prompt".

Type: conda activate ezTrack

Type: jupyter lab
